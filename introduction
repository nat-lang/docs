\section{Introduction}

natlang.online is an environment for building, evaluating, and sharing semantic grammars.
It's powered by the formal language \textbf{nat}, which makes it possible to express ideas
from the linguistic and philosophical literature on semantics in an evaluable format.

If you have a background in formal semantics, you should be able to jump right in: pick a paper
in the library that you're familiar with and experiment with it. The formalism should match
the paper closely enough to recognize.
