\section{Introduction}
natlang.online is an environment for building, evaluating, and sharing semantic grammars.
It's powered by the formal language nat, which makes it easy to express ideas
from the linguistic and philosophical literature on semantics in an evaluable format.

If you have a background in formal semantics, you should be able to jump right in: pick a paper
in the library that you're familiar with and experiment with it. The formalism should match
the paper closely enough to recognize.
