\section{Introduction}

natlang.onlineeee is an environment for building, evaluating, and sharing semantic grammars.
It's powered by the formal language \textbf{nat}, with which it's possible to express ideas from the linguistic and philosophical literature on semantics.

If you're familiar with formal semantics, you can \href{https://natlang.online/docs/getting-started}{jump right in}.
If you have a background in another area of generative linguistics, or in computer science, logic, or math, you should also be able to follow along.
