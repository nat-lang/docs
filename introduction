\section{Introduction}

natlang.online is an environment for building, evaluating, and sharing semantic grammars.
It's powered by the formal language \textbf{nat}, with which it's possible to express ideas from the linguistic and philosophical literature on semantics.

If you're familiar with formal semantics, you should be able to jump right in: pick a paper
in the library that you're familiar with and experiment with it. The formalism should match
the paper closely enough to recognize.
