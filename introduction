\section{Introduction}

natlang.online is an environment for building, evaluating, and sharing semantic grammars.
It's powered by the formal language \textbf{nat}, which makes it possible to express ideas
from the linguistic and philosophical literature on semantics in an evaluable format.

in the library that you're familiar with and experiment with it. The formalism should match
the paper closely enough to recognize.
