\textbf{nat} defines a number of objects for structuring
other objects: sets, sequences, maps, and trees.

1. Sets

To make a set, use curly braces.

codeblock "let x = {1, 2, 3};";

typeset tex"The set object comes with some familiar functions,
which you can access with the $object.function$ syntax. Some functions
have terser symbolic aliases that can be used as infixes.";

codeblock "let x = {1, 2, 3}.union({3, 4, 5});
print x.elements().values;

// Or equivalently:

let y = {1, 2, 3} & {3, 4, 5};
print x == y;
";

typeset tex"It's also possible to make a set by specifying
conditions that its elements satisfy. We call this a \textit{set comprehension}.";

codeblock "let x = {a | a in {true,false}, a};
print x.elements().values;";

typeset tex"When using the comprehension syntax, we always introduce a bound
variable and a source object with a \textit{variable in object} phrase.
These are the \textit{generators} for the comprehensions. Once a variable has been
introduced, it's in the scope of any predicates or generators to its right.";
