which you can access with the $object.function$ syntax. Some functions
have terser symbolic aliases that can be used as infixes.";

conditions that its elements satisfy. We call this a \textit{set comprehension}.";

typeset tex"When using the comprehension syntax, we always introduce a bound
variable and a source object with a \textit{variable in object} phrase.
These are the \textit{generators} for the comprehensions. Once a variable has been
introduced, we can restrict it with any number of predicates to its right. We can
also refer to it within other generators to its right.";
